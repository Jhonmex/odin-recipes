                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.

            <p>Udon noodles are thick and have a chewy texture, providing a large bite. On the other hand, ramen noodles are thin and have a firm yet chewy texture, allowing them to hold up well in the flavorful broth of ramen soup.</p>
